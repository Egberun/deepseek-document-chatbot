# DeepSeek Document Chatbot: Sample Document

This is a sample document that demonstrates how the DeepSeek Document Chatbot works with text files in the knowledge base.

## About DeepSeek LLM

DeepSeek LLM is a powerful language model developed by DeepSeek AI. It's designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. The model can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, including:

- Text generation
- Question answering
- Summarization
- Translation
- Code generation

## Document Retrieval Process

When you ask a question, the chatbot follows these steps:

1. **Vectorization**: Your query is converted into a vector representation using an embedding model.
2. **Similarity Search**: The system searches for document chunks in the vector database that are semantically similar to your query.
3. **Context Building**: The most relevant document chunks are combined to create context for the language model.
4. **Response Generation**: DeepSeek LLM generates a response based on the retrieved context and your question.
5. **Source Attribution**: The chatbot provides references to the source documents used to answer your question.

## Sample Questions

You can try asking the chatbot questions like:

- "What is DeepSeek LLM?"
- "How does the document retrieval process work?"
- "What can DeepSeek LLM be used for?"
- "Explain the vectorization process"

The chatbot should be able to provide accurate answers based on the information in this document.

## Customization Options

The DeepSeek Document Chatbot can be customized in several ways:

- **Prompt Templates**: Different system prompts can be used for various use cases
- **Model Parameters**: Adjust temperature, max tokens, and other generation parameters
- **Embedding Models**: Change the embedding model for different retrieval characteristics
- **Chunk Size**: Modify how documents are split for more effective retrieval

## Limitations

While powerful, the system has some limitations:

- It can only answer based on information present in the knowledge base
- The quality of responses depends on the quality and relevance of the documents
- Complex reasoning might require additional context or human intervention
- The system works best with well-structured, clear text documents
